# FeelingsInPixels

FeelingsInPixels is a deep learning project that analyzes facial expressions to uncover the hidden feelings behind happy and sad faces, making it easier to understand and connect with users. This project is inspired by Nicholas Renotte's "Build a Deep CNN Image Classifier with ANY Images" tutorial.

## Overview

FeelingsInPixels uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to preprocess images and train a sequential convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The trained model can accurately differentiate between happy and sad faces.

## Getting Started

To get started with FeelingsInPixels, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies.

3. Download the dataset you want to use for training (e.g., a dataset of happy and sad face images).

4. Organize your dataset and update the paths in the code accordingly.

5. Train the model.

6. Use the trained model to classify emotions in facial images.
